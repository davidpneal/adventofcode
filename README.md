# Advent of Code 2018

[Advent of Code](https://adventofcode.com)

I have decided to use these challenges to learn the syntax of Python.  As such, there will be lots of random comments and notes on (probably) obvious things.

The goal will be to solve the puzzle and then compare it to other solutions/implementations to see what other new things can be learned.
